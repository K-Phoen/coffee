# Iced coffee — Chemex

This guide is for brewing iced coffee in what's known as the Japanese Method:
brewing coffee hot over ice.

## Ingredients

* 420 grams of ice cubes
* 80 grams of coffee (roughly grinded)
* between 400 and 500 ml of boiled water (~96°C)

## Recipe

* rinse the Chemex and filter with hot water and discard water
* pile the ice cubes in the Chemex
* put the coffee in the filter
* let the hot water settle before starting to brew (do NOT pour it while it's
  still boiling)
* start brewing, as you would normally do for a *classic* Chemex brew
